Idea:
Script for "recording" source file changes (to a git repo?) during screencast to be able to refer back to a certain commit 
based on the time during the video. This requires being able to have the tracked changes as multiple commits/diffs later 
in the process and to generate a playlist/timeline for refrring back to it.
